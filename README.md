# üöò Driver Drowsiness and Yawning Detection System

A real-time monitoring system that detects driver **drowsiness** and **yawning** using facial landmark analysis and simulates vehicle behavior for safety assessment.

---

## üìå Overview

This project helps identify signs of fatigue or inattention in drivers by tracking facial features through the webcam using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**. It alerts the driver through sound when:

- The eyes are closed for too long (possible drowsiness).
- The mouth is open for an extended time (yawning).
- Simulated vehicle data indicates erratic behavior (e.g., sudden braking and low speed).

## üöÄ Features

- üëÅÔ∏è **Drowsiness Detection** using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- üëÑ **Yawning Detection** using lip distance measurement
- üìà **Simulated Vehicle Behavior** (speed and brake status)
- üîä **Beep Alerts** using `winsound`
- üéØ Real-time facial tracking via **MediaPipe Face Mesh**
- üßµ Multithreading to handle both detection and data simulation simultaneously
- üõë **Automatic Speed Reduction** during drowsiness detection

## üñ•Ô∏è Demo

> Run the project, and the webcam will open. Real-time detection results will appear as overlays on the video frame. When drowsiness or yawning is detected, visual indicators and alert sounds will be triggered.
